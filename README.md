# React Practice Project

# 🎲 React Dice Game – Practice Project #3

This is my **third practice project in React**.  
The goal of this project was to build a **simple and interactive dice game** using reusable components, state management, and basic logic.

---

## 🧠 Game Logic

- The user selects a number between **1 to 6**
- Then rolls the dice
- If the dice matches the selected number → 🟢 **User gains that number of points**
- If not → 🔴 **User loses 2 points**
- Score updates live based on user’s success/failure

---

## ⚙️ Project Overview

- Built using **React functional components**
- Managed state with **useState hook**
- Components used:
  - `TotalScore`
  - `NumberSelector`
  - `StartGame`
  - `Rules`
  - `RoleDice`
  - `GamePlay`
- Used **styled-components** for styling and theming
- User feedback through error messages
- Modular code structure for clarity
